# Replication
When I run the `ConfigurationPropertiesTest`, I get:
```
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to load ApplicationContext
Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'push1-ind.ericjturley.mcve.configurationproperties.PushServicesProperties1': Unsatisfied dependency expressed through constructor parameter 0; nested exception is ...
Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type 'ind.ericjturley.mcve.configurationproperties.PushServicesProperties1$SnsClient' available: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate. Dependency annotations: {}
```

Looks like commenting out `@ConfigurationProperties` on the `.kt` class `PushServiceProperties1` will toggle the failure.
(I had originally thought it was the injection into the test class)

# Overview
These classes are pulled from an existing project (and possibly renamed).

The project is a library intended for use in a Spring Boot Application.
Hence, it doesn't have `spring-boot-starter-parent` as a parent, but does:
* import the `spring-boot-dependencies` bom
* depend on `spring-boot-starter`

It's mostly Java, with a few Kotlin classes/files.
